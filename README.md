# Who am I
I am just a fucking nerd.
My dream is to realize the *strong AI*

I love learning computer tech, esp. computer languages.
I master Python, Matlab, LaTex, and I'm also good at Lua, Ruby, ever made codes in HTML/CSS/JS, Haskell/Lisp.
Sublime Text is my favourite editors recently, someday I will try to use VSCode.

Do not be shy, just talk with me.
