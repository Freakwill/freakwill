# Who am I
I am just a bloody fucking nerd.
My dream is to realize the *strong AI*

I love learning computer tech, esp. computer languages.
I master Python, Matlab, LaTex whenever you believe or not, and I'm also good at Lua/MoonScript, Ruby/Crystal, also code by HTML/CSS/JS/TS/CoffeeScript/HAML/Stylus, Haskell/Lisp.
Sublime Text is my favourite editors currently, and I use VSCode more frequent than before.

I studied Wavelet analysis for Master degree, Harmonic analysis for PhD. Now I study machine learning for my dream.

Do not be shy, just talk with me.
