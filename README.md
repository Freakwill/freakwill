# Who am I
I am just a fucking bloody and creepy and spooky (not snoopyüê∂) nerd. ü§ì
My dream is to realize the *strong AI*

I love learning computer tech, esp. computer languages.
I master Python, Matlab, LaTex whenever you believe or not, and I'm also good at Lua/MoonScript, Ruby/Crystal, also code by HTML/CSS/JS/TS/CoffeeScript/HAML/Stylus, Lisp/Haskell, Julia, Go, R. Recently, I am learning Nim. If you are interested one of them, just tell me.
Sublime Text is my favourite editors currently, and I use VSCode more frequent than before.

I studied Wavelet analysis for Master degree, Harmonic analysis for PhD. Now I study machine learning for my dream.

I am employed by BIMSA.

Do not be shy, just talk with me.
