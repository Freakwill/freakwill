# Who am I
I am just a fucking nerd.
My dream is to realize the *strong AI*

I love learning computer tech, esp. computer languages.
I master Python, Matlab, LaTex, and I'm also good at Lua/MoonScript, Ruby/Crystal, ever made codes by HTML/CSS/JS/TS/CoffeeScript, Haskell/Lisp.
Sublime Text is my favourite editors recently, someday I will try to use VSCode.

Do not be shy, just talk with me.
